# Accurate Models of Dead Time-Affected PSDs with Approximate Bayesian Computation

Dead time is a common problem in the timing analysis of bright sources. For some dead time 
cases, analytical expressions exist (e.g. for the cospectrum), but often, these leave 
systematic biases in the data that can significantly alter the inference of certain 
parameters (e.g. the fractional rms amplitude) important to the physical interpretation of 
PSDs.

On the other hand, dead time is relatively simple to simulate, and it is thus easy and 
inexpensive to simulate dead time-affected periodograms of stochastic signals. Here, we 
introduce a method for accurate parameter inference using Approximate Bayesian Computation.
